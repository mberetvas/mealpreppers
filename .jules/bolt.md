## 2025-05-22 - [N+1 Query Optimization in Recipe Repository]

**Learning:** The `list_recipes` implementation in `src-tauri/src/shadow_server/recipe_catalog/repository.rs` followed a classic N+1 query pattern, fetching ingredients and steps one-by-one for each recipe. This is particularly costly in a local database context where many small queries add up, especially if the library grows large.

**Action:** Prefer batched queries using `IN` clauses and memory-side grouping with `HashMap` to fetch related entities in bulk. This reduces database round-trips from `1 + 2N` to exactly 3.
